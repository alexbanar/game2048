The build image command is 'docker build -t fxgame_img .'
The run image command is 'docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 fxgame_img'

1)
Expected:
'FROM gradle:jdk14 as builder'. 
There are two FROM lines in this Dockerfile. Each FROM defines a stage, and a stage can optionally have a name.
The first FROM is named 'builder'. We can reference it in the following stage by this name.
The 'builder' stage is based on the Gradle Docker image for Java 14. 
It contains both a Java 14 JDK and a Gradle installation.
Result: as Expected:

2)
Expected:
Coping to our project files including Java source code by 'COPY --chown=gradle:gradle . /home/gradle/fxgame',
will copy our project to /home/gradle/fxgame directory inside the container to the directory /home/gradle/fxgame.
Result: as Expected:

3)
Expected:
'WORKDIR /home/gradle/fxgame' - defines new default path /home/gradle/fxgame in the first(current) FROM stage
Result: as Expected:

4)
Expected:
'RUN gradle dist --no-daemon' command will generate zip archive in build\dist directory. 
 Runs in the first FROM stage and performs Gradle build(compile) too.
 The 'dist' task generates (depending on your OS) binaries for Windows, Mac or Linux,
 with Java bundled in (using Java 14 jlink custom images).
 
 Result: Error:
  Task :jlink FAILED
  Error: Error reading module: /home/gradle/fxgame/build/jlinkbase/jlinkjars/fxgame.jar
  Execution failed for task ':jlink'.
